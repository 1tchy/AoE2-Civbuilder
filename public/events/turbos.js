<div>&emsp;&emsp;The Ultimate Random Build Order Showdown, also known as TURBOS, is a 2v2 Age of Empires II DE tournament.
Every game of the tournament will be played with a data mod that randomizes costs.
However, these mods will be made public one week before the tournament begins, allowing teams to prepare their own build orders and strategies.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Registration is open to everyone, and teams will be seeded into a single-elimination bracket based on average ranked 1v1 RM rating. Registration closes at midnight PST on March 11th.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the tournament, there is a $100 competition to speedrun completing a wonder with random costs.
Anyone can enter by simply submitting a replay of their game or recording of their gameplay.</div>`

<div>&emsp;&emsp;Matches will be played in a single-elimination bracket.  The semi-finals and finals will be played as a best of 5 games, with all other matches being a best of 3 games.
The prize pool is split $150 awarded to the first place team and $50 to the second place team.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;At midnight PST on March 12th, 5 data mods will be made public each with their own randomization of game costs. The 5 maps in the map pool will also be made public at that time.
Note that each map will always pair with a randomization, meaning playing on map #2 also means playing with randomization #2.
Game 1 of each set will always be played with map and randomization #1.
This pattern will continue until the match concludes, i.e. game 2 will be played with map and randomization #2, game 3 with randomization #3, etc.
Civilizations are hidden-pick with no repetitions allowed per player within a match.
Settings for all games will be identical to Ranked RM 2v2 â€“ Conquest, 200 population, no treaty or time limit, etc.
<br><br>
